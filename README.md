# life-the-game
A c++ game I made at a summer camp.

To play this game, just navigate to and compile the included files in the `src` directory. Directions for linux:
```shell
g++ -o output Source.cpp item.h
```
The file `save.txt` is a savefile for the game that is very overpowered. You can use it or any other savefiles by putting it in the same directory as the `lifethegame.exe`.
